# polls-app
This repository contains front end and bakend code for polls application. Using the application user can create, view and participate in polls. This app has been created using the following tech stack:

- Spring Boot REST API's
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- Postgres
- Docker
- React

The application will be developed over a period of time and I will be adding features of oAuth2 PKCE using Keycloak as well.
